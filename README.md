# egghead-instructor-center

A temporary lightweight wrapper around [egghead-ui](https://github.com/eggheadio/egghead-ui). This project just wires up routing and authentication around these egghead-ui components and then deploys them to [instructor.egghead.io](https://instructor.egghead.io). Eventually this project will dissolve into [egghead-rails](https://github.com/eggheadio/egghead-rails), which will consume the `egghead-ui` components directly inside it's own routing, authentication, error tracking etc.
